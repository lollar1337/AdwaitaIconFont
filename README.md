## Info about the Icons and Font

Icons are made originally by the GNOME Project [GNOME Gitlab Adwaita Icon Theme](https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/adwaita-icon-theme)

Some Icons were edited to work in a Font (Wifi and Cellular Icons)

The ttf file was created using [Fontello](https://fontello.com/)

The Original creator of those Icons is the GNOME Project not me.
